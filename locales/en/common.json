  "aboutText": "For detailed information about 'Gutenberg publishing house' and books published by the publishing house.",
  "aboutParagraph1": "Gutenberg is a modern audio library that gives you access to a catalog of bestsellers and classic literature, including news from various genres: from fiction to non-fiction and business books. Over 368,000 audio books in more than twenty different genres.",
  "aboutParagraph2": "The library's usual idea is that instead of buying individual books, you can access the entire catalog. We don't sell books and force you to download them, but we give them to you for reading without restrictions and on various devices. A subscription is enough.",
  "aboutParagraph3": "In the usual sense, e-books have so far been similar to paper books: these are separate files that need to be downloaded and stored somewhere, then thrown to the reader-reader, and if you have several reading devices, you will have to store a separate copy in each of your libraries. If you not only read books, but also save bookmarks and notes, you often have to manually synchronize all this.",
  "aboutParagraph4": "For avid readers and with pleasure, we decided to turn MyBook into a library club, by joining which you can read not only the books you have, but also publications from our extensive catalog.",
